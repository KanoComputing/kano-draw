		    "hint": "The graphics in Asteroids were simple line based graphics called vectors, we still use a more complex version of this concept in computer graphics today. First we need to set our line colour and width **type** `stroke white,5`",

		    "hint": "We use the line function to draw a line relative to our starting position, we use a negative number first to move to the left and a positive number second to move downward **type** `line -50,150`",

		    "hint": "We draw a line down the centre to help the simple shape look more like a ship, early videogames had only a fraction of computing power we are used to today, so graphics had to be basic. **type** `line 0,125`",
