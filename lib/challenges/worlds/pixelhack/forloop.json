		    "hint": "We're going to recreate the classic game Snake using the power of For Loops. First let's set a dirt background**type** `background tan`",

		    "hint": "This is where we will set the loop up, using the for function, the first number is where to start counting from and the second number is what to count to. So 1 .. 7 makes the computer count to 7  - **type** `for [1 .. 7]`",
